/**
 * Device is a very simple abstraction of any emulation component. A device
 * performs some sort of action on every clock tick, unless it is waiting for a
 * number of cycles to elapse (waitCycles > 0). A device might also be paused or
 * suspended.
 *
 * Depending on the type of device, some special work might be required to
 * attach or detach it to the active emulation (such as what should happen when
 * a card is inserted or removed from a slot?)
