* All graphics modes are supported, including Apple RGB "Mixed" and B&W modes.
* Fullscreen and windowed modes supported
* PassPort MIDI support for Ultima V
* MetaCheat allows quick and easy ability to find and alter active memory
* MetaCheat also provides a live heat-map showing all RAM activity, color coded to indicate read, write or CPU execution -- Perfect for reverse engineers
* Optional Debugging rom (][DB) can be enabled for a more powerful monitor
* Super serial emulated as a tcp/ip port
* Mockingboard and Phasor support
* Highly flexible configuration allows any combination of cards and many extra options. You can even alter configuration while the emulation is running!
