California Gold is drying up and tensions are sky high.

The year is 1856, and one by one gold mines and claims are closing down as
the gold pans out. Gunfights break out at the drop of a hat, or the sight
of a speck of gold dust. Robbers, road agents, and other scoundrel are more
common than prospectors! With the wealth of the region slowly drying up,
everything in the towns is spiraling into chaos.

The wilderness is a whole other ball of wax, what with wild game and bears
roaming closer to towns now. But that ain't the worst of it. There's been
sightings of unnatural things deep within the nearby mountains.

Oh, and did we mention you're the new sheriff?
