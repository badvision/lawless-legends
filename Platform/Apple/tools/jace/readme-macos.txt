About the Game:
The year is 1856, you have just arrived at Fort Miller, near Mariposa California. 
The gold rush has now past its peak and the region is slowly being overrun with 
cutthroats, thieves, murderers, and the like. There are rumors of mysterious, 
unnatural things taking place behind the curtain of mountains beyond the local ridges.
Most folks are too nervous to venture far from town...even for gold.

Technical Notes:
This application includes its own Java runtime - no need to install Java separately.
