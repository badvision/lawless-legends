/**
 * A configurable field annotation means that an object property can be changed
 * by the end-user.
 * NOTE: Any field that implements this must be public and serializable!
 * If a field is not serializable, it will result in a serialization error
 * when the configuration is being saved.  There is no way to offer a compiler
 * warning to avoid this, unfortunately.
 * One way you can work with this constraint when allowing large reconfiguration
 * of functionality, such as Cards or other class implementations of hardware,
 * is to store the class itself of the component as a configuration value
 * and let the Reconfigure method generate a new instance.
